# Introduction

An introduction of your lab work, and what you knew about exploratory and manual
functional testing before this lab

# High-level description of the exploratory testing plan

- Scope: core functionalities such as account validation and withdrawals
- Objective: find critical bugs and ensure system requirements are met
- Strategy: breadth-first approach to quickly identify any errors from common paths for all functions. This is to ensure that the system at least delivers the basic requirements for an ATM. A second round of tests will occur afterwards to catch exceptional paths.
- Reporting: use bug reporting tool; DevOps to keeps records of bugs found in testing

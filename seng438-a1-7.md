# Introduction

This assignment explores three different techniques for bug testing in software development; exploratory, manual scripted, and regression testing, and familiarizes us with defect tracking systems. Exploratory testing, also called manual non-scripted testing, encourages testers to freely explore the system under test (SUT) as if they were real users of the program. Thus, testers can use any method to uncover bugs or problems in user experience. Because it is not predefined, this method can uncover defects that scripted tests may miss. On the other hand, manual scripted testing uses a predefined testing suite that defines a list of test cases that must be checked. Although the documentation used for this testing allows for ease in repeatability, the predefined nature of the test cases may restrict the number of bugs found. The last bug testing method; regression testing, is used after a system version update. It analyses the SUT again to ensure that the update did not break any of the previously tested test cases. All three of these testing methods are vital to the software development process to ensure that software releases are stable and as defect-free as possible.

# High-level description of the exploratory testing plan

- Scope: core functionalities such as account validation and withdrawals
- Objective: find critical bugs and ensure system requirements are met
- Strategy: breadth-first approach to quickly identify any errors from common paths for all functions. This is to ensure that the system at least delivers the basic requirements for an ATM. A second round of tests will occur afterwards to catch exceptional paths.
- Reporting: use bug reporting tool; DevOps to keeps records of bugs found in testing

# Comparison of exploratory and manual functional testing

-   Note that you need to submit a report generated by your defect tracking
    system, containing all defects recorded in the system.
